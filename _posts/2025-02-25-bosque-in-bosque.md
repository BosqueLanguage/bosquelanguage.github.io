Happy new year to everyone! Got off the blogging track a bit after the new year but, hopefully, will be back on track now. I just merged [PR #185](https://github.com/BosqueLanguage/BosqueCore/commit/ce81effe6a80de0973ced8840a7b2ad702d55128) and it seems like a good one to highlight a bit.

This specific PR marks the 

_solvable language_

We have hit a fun milestone in the project -- going forward we are (primarily) implementing the Bosque compiler, and other features, in Bosque itself! This is an exciting step as it allows us to dogfood the language, experience writing code at in the language at scale, make sure it we don't have any blind spots, identify any weak areas in the language/compiler/toolchain, and push the boundaries of what it can do.
